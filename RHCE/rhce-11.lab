Lab: Lab: Analyzing and Storing Logs
In this lab, students will change the time zone and log all authentication failure log entries into a separate file.

Outcomes:

On serverX, the timezone is set correctly for Jamaica, a command is run to display all journal entries recorded in the last 30 minutes, and rsyslog is configured to send all authpriv facility messages with alert or higher priority to a new log file, /var/log/auth-errors.

Reset your serverX system.

Your serverX machine has been relocated to Jamaica. Change the time zone on the serverX machine to Jamaica and verify the time zone has been changed properly.

Identify the correct time zone for Jamaica on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# timedatectl list-timezones
Africa/Abidjan
Africa/Accra
Africa/Addis_Ababa
Africa/Algiers
Africa/Asmara
...
America/Jamaica
...
Change the time zone to Jamaica on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# timedatectl set-timezone America/Jamaica
Verify the time zone has been properly set on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# timedatectl
      Local time: Thu 2014-02-13 11:16:59 EST
  Universal time: Thu 2014-02-13 16:16:59 UTC
        RTC time: Thu 2014-02-13 16:17:00
        Timezone: America/Jamaica (EST, -0500)
     NTP enabled: yes
NTP synchronized: no
 RTC in local TZ: no
      DST active: n/a
Display all systemd journal entries recorded in the last 30 minutes on serverX.

Assuming the current time is 9:30:00, the following command would be used

[root@serverX ~]# journalctl --since 9:00:00 --until 9:30:00
Configure rsyslogd so that it records syslog messages related to authentication and security issues that have priority alert or higher to the file /var/log/auth-errors. Use the file /etc/rsyslog.d/auth-errors.conf to do this, creating the file if necessary. Test these changes by using the logger command.

Add the directive to log authpriv.alert syslog messages to the /var/log/auth-errors file in the /etc/rsyslog.d/auth-errors.conf configuration file.

[root@serverX ~]# echo "authpriv.alert /var/log/auth-errors" >/etc/rsyslog.d/auth-errors.conf
Restart the rsyslog service on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# systemctl restart rsyslog
Use the logger to create a new log entry to the /var/log/auth-errors on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# logger -p authpriv.alert "Logging test authpriv.alert"
Verify the message sent to syslog with the logger command appears in the /var/log/auth-errors on serverX in the terminal with tail /var/log/auth-errors.

[root@serverX ~]# tail /var/log/auth-errors
Feb 13 11:21:53 server1 root: Logging test authpriv.alert
