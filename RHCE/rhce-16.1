Defining the Anaconda Kickstart System
Kickstart automates Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation using a text file.

Kickstart configuration files start with commands, followed by the %packages section.

Optional %post and %pre sections can contain scripting that customizes installations.

Objectives
After completing this section, students should be able to identify key configuration elements found inside a Kickstart configuration file.

Introduction to Kickstart installations
A system administrator can automate the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux using a feature called Kickstart. Anaconda, the Red Hat installer, needs to be told how to install a system: partition disks, configure network interfaces, select which packages to install, etc. This is an interactive process by default. A Kickstart installation uses a text file to provide all of the answers to these questions, so no interaction is required.

NOTE
Kickstart in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is similar to Jumpstart for Oracle Solaris, or to an unattended installation for Microsoft Windows.

Kickstart configuration files begin with a list of commands that define how the target machine is to be installed. Lines that start with # characters are comments that are ignored by the installer. Additional sections begin with a line that starts with a % character and end with a line with the %end directive.

The %packages section specifies the software to be installed on the target system. Individual packages are specified by name (without versions). Package groups can be specified by name or ID, and start with an @ character. Environment groups (groups of package groups) can be specified with the @^ followed immediately by the name or ID of the environment group. Groups have mandatory, default, and optional components. Normally, mandatory and default components will be installed by Kickstart. Package or group names that are preceded with a - character are excluded from installation unless they are mandatory or installed due to RPM dependencies from other packages.

Two additional sections are the %pre and %post scripts. %post scripts are more common. They configure the system after all of the software has been installed. The %pre script is executed before any disk partitioning is done.

The configuration commands must be specified first. The %pre, %post, and %packages can occur in any order after the configuration commands.

Kickstart configuration file commands
Installation commands

url: Specifies the location for the installation media.

Example:

url --url="ftp://installserver.example.com/pub/RHEL7/dvd"
repo: This option tells Anaconda where to find the packages for installation. This option must point to a valid yum repository.

Example:

repo --name="Custom Packages" --baseurl="ftp://repo.example.com/custom"
text: Forces text mode install.

vnc: Allows the graphical installation to be viewed remotely via VNC.

Example:

vnc --password=redhat
askmethod: Do not automatically use the CD-ROM as the source of packages when installation media is detected in the CD-ROM drive.

Partitioning commands

clearpart: Clears the specified partitions before installation.

Example:

clearpart --all --drives=sda,sdb --initlabel
part: Specifies the size, format, and name of a partition.

Example:

part /home --fstype=ext4 --label=homes --size=4096 --maxsize=8192 --grow
ignoredisk: Ignores the specified disks when installing.

Example:

ignoredisk --drives=sdc
bootloader: Defines where to install the bootloader.

Example:

bootloader --location=mbr --boot-drive=sda
volgroup, logvol: Creates LVM volume groups and logical volumes.

Example:

part pv.01 --size=8192
volgroup myvg pv.01
logvol / --vgname=myvg --fstype=xfs --size=2048 --name=rootvol --grow
logvol /var --vgname=myvg --fstype=xfs --size=4096 --name=varvol
zerombr: Disks whose formatting is unrecognized are initialized.

Network commands

network: Configures network information for target system and activates network devices in installer environment.

Example:

network --device=eth0 --bootproto=dhcp
firewall: This option defines how the firewall will be configured on the target system.

Example:

firewall --enabled --service=ssh,cups
Configuration commands

lang: This required command sets the language to use during installation and the default language of the installed system.

Example:

lang en_US.UTF-8
keyboard: This required command sets the system keyboard type.

Example:

keyboard --vckeymap=us --xlayouts='us','us'
timezone: Defines timezone, NTP servers, and whether the hardware clock uses UTC.

Example:

timezone --utc --ntpservers=time.example.com Europe/Amsterdam
auth: This required command sets up the authentication options for the system.

Example:

auth --useshadow --enablemd5 --passalgo=sha512
rootpw: Defines the initial root password.

Example:

rootpw --plaintext redhat
or

rootpw --iscrypted $6$KUnFfrTzO8jv.PiH$YlBbOtXBkWzoMuRfb0.SpbQ....XDR1UuchoMG1
selinux: Sets the state of SELinux on the installed system.

Example:

selinux --enforcing
services: Modifies the default set of services that will run under the default runlevel.

Example:

services --disabled=network,iptables,ip6tables --enabled=NetworkManager,firewalld
group, user: Create a local group or user on the system.

Example:

group --name=admins --gid=10001
user --name=jdoe --gecos="John Doe" --groups=admins --password=changeme --plaintext
Miscellaneous commands

logging: This command defines how Anaconda will log during the installation.

Example:

logging --host=loghost.example.com --level=info
firstboot: Determines whether firstboot starts the first time the system is booted.

Example:

firstboot --disabled
reboot, poweroff, halt: Specify what should happen after the installation finishes.

NOTE
The ksverdiff utility from the pykickstart package is useful for identifying changes in Kickstart file syntax between two versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora.

For example, ksverdiff -f RHEL6 -t RHEL7 will identify changes in syntax from RHEL 6 to RHEL 7. Available versions are listed in the top of the file /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pykickstart/version.py.

Example Kickstart file:
The first part of the file consists of the installation commands, like disk partitioning and installation source.

#version=RHEL7
# System authorization information
auth --useshadow --enablemd5
# Use network installation
url --url="http://classroom.example.com/content/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd/"
# Firewall configuration
firewall --enabled --service=ssh
firstboot --disable
ignoredisk --only-use=vda
# Keyboard layouts
keyboard --vckeymap=us --xlayouts='us','us'
# System language
lang en_US.UTF-8
# Installation logging level
logging --level=info
# Network information
network  --bootproto=dhcp
# Root password
rootpw --iscrypted $6$/h/Mumvarr2dKrv1$Krv7h9.QoV0s....foMXsGXP1KllaiJ/w7EWiL1
# SELinux configuration
selinux --enforcing
# System services
services --disabled="kdump,rhsmcertd" --enabled="network,sshd,rsyslog,chronyd"
# System timezone
timezone --utc America/Los_Angeles
# System bootloader configuration
bootloader --location=mbr --boot-drive=vda
# Clear the Master Boot Record
zerombr
# Partition clearing information
clearpart --all --initlabel 
# Disk partitioning information
part / --fstype="xfs" --ondisk=vda --size=10000
The second part contains the %packages section, detailing which packages and package groups should be installed, and which packages shouldn't be installed.

%packages
@core
chrony
cloud-init
dracut-config-generic
dracut-norescue
firewalld
grub2
kernel
rsync
tar
-NetworkManager
-plymouth
 
%end
The last part contains any %pre and %post installation scripts.

%post --erroronfail
 
# For cloud images, 'eth0' _is_ the predictable device name, since
# we don't want to be tied to specific virtual (!) hardware
rm -f /etc/udev/rules.d/70*
ln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-name-slot.rules
 
# simple eth0 config, again not hard-coded to the build hardware
cat > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 << EOF
DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
ONBOOT="yes"
TYPE="Ethernet"
USERCTL="yes"
PEERDNS="yes"
IPV6INIT="no"
EOF
 
%end
NOTE
In a Kickstart file, missing required values cause the installer to interactively prompt for an answer or to abort the installation entirely.
