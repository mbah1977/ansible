Lab: Lab: Configuring MariaDB Databases
In this lab, you will install, configure, restore, and populate a MariaDB database.

Resources:
Files:	/home/student/mariadb.dump
Machines:	desktopX and serverX
Outcomes:

A MariaDB service listening for remote connections. A backup file will be restored and three users with different privileges will be created.

Reset your desktopX system.

Reset your serverX system.

Log into and set up your serverX system.

[student@serverX ~]$ lab mariadb setup
Log into and set up your desktopX system.

[student@desktopX ~]$ lab mariadb setup
Your developers are working on a legacy system, and the MariaDB has stopped working. You have the logical backup file from last night. You are asked to install a new MariaDB database server and to restore from this backup.

A new ticket has been assigned to you to create new remote access accounts with the following information:

User	Password	Privileges
mary	mary_password	Select on all tables from legacy database
legacy	legacy_password	Select, insert, update, delete on all tables from legacy database
report	report_password	Select on all tables from legacy database
Since developers do not have access to the production environment, they asked you to insert new records in the manufacturer table:

Name	Seller	Phone number
HP	Joe Doe	+1 (432) 754-3509
Dell	Luke Skywalker	+1 (431) 219-4589
Lenovo	Darth Vader	+1 (327) 647-6784
Install MariaDB database groups.

Install the MariaDB client on your desktopX machine.

[root@desktopX ~]# yum groupinstall mariadb-client -y
Install MariaDB database server on your serverX machine.

[root@serverX ~]# yum groupinstall mariadb -y
Start and enable the MariaDB service.

Start the MariaDB service.

[root@serverX ~]# systemctl start mariadb.service
Enable the MariaDB service.

[root@serverX ~]# systemctl enable mariadb.service
Configure the firewall to accept remote connections.

[root@serverX ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
[root@serverX ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
Create the legacy database.

Connect to the MariaDB database server.

[root@serverX ~]# mysql -u root
Create the legacy database.

MariaDB [(none)]> create database legacy;
MariaDB [(none)]> exit;
Restore the database backup (/home/student/mariadb.dump).

[root@serverX ~]# mysql -u root legacy < /home/student/mariadb.dump
Create users according to the ticket.

Connect to the MariaDB database server.

[root@serverX ~]# mysql -u root
Create user mary.

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER mary@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mary_password'; 
Create user legacy.

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER legacy@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'legacy_password'; 
Create user report.

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER report@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'report_password'; 
Grant privileges to mary.

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT SELECT ON legacy.* TO mary@'%'; 
Grant privileges to legacy.

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON legacy.* TO legacy@'%'; 
Grant privileges to report.

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT SELECT ON legacy.* TO report@'%'; 
Flush privileges.

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
Insert the new manufacturers.

Select legacy database.

MariaDB [(none)]> USE legacy; 
Describe table to verify attributes.

MariaDB [(legacy)]> DESCRIBE manufacturer;

Insert HP as manufacturer.

MariaDB [(legacy)]> INSERT INTO manufacturer(name,seller,phone_number) values ('HP','Joe Doe','+1 (432) 754-3509'); 
Insert Dell as manufacturer.

MariaDB [(legacy)]> INSERT INTO manufacturer(name,seller,phone_number) values ('DELL','Luke Skywalker','+1 (431) 219-4589'); 
Insert Lenovo as manufacturer.

MariaDB [(legacy)]> INSERT INTO manufacturer(name,seller,phone_number) values ('Lenovo','Darth Vader','+1 (327) 647-6784'); 
From your desktopX system, validate your work.
