Managing Software Updates with yum
yum is used to install and update software packages.

Objectives
After completing this section, students should be able to find, install, and update software packages using the yum command.

Working with yum
yum is a powerful command-line tool that can be used to more flexibly manage (install, update, remove, and query) software packages. Official Red Hat packages are normally downloaded from Red Hat's content distribution network. Registering a system to the subscription management service automatically configures access to software repositories based on the attached subscriptions.

Finding software with yum

yum help will display usage information.

yum list displays installed and available packages.

[root@serverX ~]# yum list 'http*'

yum search KEYWORD lists packages by keywords found in the name and summary fields only.

To search for packages that have "web server" in their name, summary, and description fields, use search all:

yum update PACKAGENAME obtains and installs a newer version of the software package, including any dependencies. Generally the process tries to preserve configuration files in place, but in some cases, they may be renamed if the packager thinks the old one will not work after the update. With no PACKAGENAME specified, it will install all relevant updates.

[root@serverX ~]# yum update
Since a new kernel can only be tested by booting to that kernel, the package is specifically designed so that multiple versions may be installed at once. If the new kernel fails to boot, the old kernel is still available. Using yum update kernel will actually install the new kernel. The configuration files hold a list of packages to "always install" even if the administrator requests an update.

NOTE
Use yum list kernel to list all installed and available kernels. To view the currently running kernel, use the uname command. The -r option will show only the kernel version and release, and the -a option will show the kernel release and additional information.

yum remove PACKAGENAME removes an installed software package, including any supported packages.

[root@serverX ~]# yum remove httpd
WARNING
yum remove will remove the package(s) listed and any package that requires the package(s) being removed (and package(s) which require those packages, and so on). This can lead to unexpected removal of packages, so carefully check the list of packages to be removed.

Installing and removing groups of software with yum

yum also has the concept of groups, which are collections of related software installed together for a particular purpose. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, there are two kinds of groups. Regular groups are collections of packages. Environment groups are collections of other groups which include their own packages. The packages or groups provided by a group may be mandatory (must be installed if the group is installed), default (are normally installed if the group is installed), or optional (are not installed when the group is unless asked for specifically).

Like yum list, the yum group list (or yum grouplist) command will show the names of installed and available groups. Some groups are normally installed through environment groups and are hidden by default. These hidden groups can also be listed with the yum group list hidden command. If the ids option is added, the group ID will also be shown. Groups can be installed, updated, removed, and otherwise queried by name or ID.

[root@serverX ~]# yum group list
Loaded plugins: langpacks
Available environment groups:
   Minimal install
   Infrastructure Server
   File and Print Server

   Fonts
   Input Methods
   Internet Browser
   PostgreSQL Database server
   Printing client

Available Groups:
   Additional Development
   Backup Client
   Backup Server
...
Information about a group is displayed with yum group info (or yum groupinfo). It includes a list of mandatory, default, and optional package names or group IDs. The package names or group IDs may have a marker in front of them.

Marker	Meaning
=	Package is installed, was installed as part of the group
+	Package isn't installed, will be if the group is installed or updated
-	Package isn't installed, will not be if the group is installed or updated
no marker	Package is installed, but was not installed through the group.

IMPORTANT
The behavior of yum groups has changed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier. In RHEL 7, groups are treated as objects, and are tracked by the system. If an installed group is updated, and new mandatory or default packages have been added to the group by the yum repository, those new packages will be installed on update.

RHEL 6 and earlier consider a group to be installed if all its mandatory packages have been installed; or if it had no mandatory packages, if any default or optional packages in the group are installed. In RHEL 7, a group is considered to be installed only if yum group install was used to install it. A new command in RHEL 7, yum group mark install GROUPNAME can be used to mark a group as installed, and any missing packages and their dependencies will be installed on the next update.

Finally, RHEL 6 and earlier did not have the two-word form of the yum group commands. In other words, in RHEL 6 the command yum grouplist existed, but the equivalent RHEL 7 command yum group list did not.

Viewing transaction history

All install and remove transactions are logged in /var/log/yum.log.
