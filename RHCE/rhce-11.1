System Log Architecture
The log architecture consists of systemd-journald for collecting and rsyslog to sort and write log messages to the log files.

Objectives
After completing this section, students should be able to describe the basic syslog architecture in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

System logging
Processes and the operating system kernel need to be able to record a log of events that happen. These logs can be useful for auditing the system and troubleshooting problems. By convention, the /var/log directory is where these logs are persistently stored.

A standard logging system based on the Syslog protocol is built into Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Many programs use this system to record events and organize them into log files. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, syslog messages are handled by two services, systemd-journald and rsyslog.

The systemd-journald daemon provides an improved log management service that collects messages from the kernel, the early stages of the boot process, standard output and error of daemons as they start up and run, and syslog. It writes these messages to a structured journal of events that, by default, does not persist between reboots. This allows syslog messages and events which are missed by syslog to be collected in one central database. The syslog messages are also forwarded by systemd-journald to rsyslog for further processing.

The rsyslog service then sorts the syslog messages by type (or facility) and priority, and writes them to persistent files in the /var/log directory.

The /var/log directory holds various system- and service-specific log files maintained by rsyslog:

Table 11.1. Overview of system log files

Log file	Purpose
/var/log/messages

Most syslog messages are logged here. The exceptions are messages related to authentication and email processing, that periodically run jobs, and those which are purely debugging-related.

/var/log/secure

The log file for security and authentication-related messages and errors.

/var/log/maillog

The log file with mail server-related messages.

/var/log/cron

The log file related to periodically executed tasks.

/var/log/boot.log

Messages related to system startup are logged here.
