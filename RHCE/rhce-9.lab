Lab: Lab: Controlling Services and Daemons
In this lab, you will manage a service unit that is already installed on the system.

Outcomes:

The psacct service is enabled and running on the system, and the rsyslog service is disabled and no longer running on the system.

Reset your serverX system.

Start the psacct service.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl start psacct
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl status psacct
Configure the psacct service so that it starts at system boot.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl enable psacct
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl status psacct
Stop the rsyslog service.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl stop rsyslog
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl status rsyslog
Configure the rsyslog service so that it does not start at system boot.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl disable rsyslog
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl status rsyslog
Reboot the system, then run lab services grade to verify the configuration.

[student@serverX ~]$ lab services grade
