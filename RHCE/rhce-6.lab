Lab: Lab: Managing Priority of Linux Processes
In this lab, you will search for processes with high CPU consumption and adjust their nice levels.

Resources
Files:	/usr/local/bin/lab nice
Machines:	desktopX
Outcomes:

The nice level of the top CPU consumers adjusted to play well with others.

Reset your desktopX system.

Log into and set up your desktopX system.

[student@desktopX ~]$ lab nice setup
Using either top or ps, identify the two top CPU consumers on your desktopX system. If gnome-shell is among the top two, ignore it and take the next highest process. Make sure to note the process IDs of these two processes.

Either run top and note the two top processes, or run the following:

[student@desktopX ~]$ ps aux --sort=pcpu
When using the ps version, the top CPU consumers will be on the bottom, with their PID listed in the second column.

From the command line, set the nice level of the processes you found in the previous step to 10.

[student@desktopX ~]$ sudo renice -n 10 <PROCESSPID1> <PROCESSPID2>
Make sure to replace <PROCESSPID1> and <PROCESSPID2> with the process IDs you identified in the previous step.

Grade your work by running the following command:

[student@desktopX ~]$ lab nice grade
Important cleanup: When you have successfully graded your work, clean up by running the following command:

[student@desktopX ~]$ lab nice clean
