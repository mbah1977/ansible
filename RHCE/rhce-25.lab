Lab: Lab: Providing Apache HTTPD Web Service
In this lab, you will configure your serverX to serve a Python WSGI web application over HTTPS.

Resources:
Files:	/home/student/webapp.wsgi
Machines:	desktopX and serverX
Outcomes:

A TLS virtual host serving a Python WSGI web application on the https://webappX.example.com domain.

Reset your desktopX system.

Reset your serverX system.

Log into and set up your serverX system.

[student@serverX ~]$ lab webapp setup
Your developers are working on a new web-based application written in Python. They have asked you to configure the httpd service on serverX to run this application on the https://webappX.example.com domain, using TLS encryption.

The application is programmed to be run behind a web server that support WSGI.

To configure the application, you will need the following information:

File	Download location
TLS certificate	http://classroom/pub/tls/certs/webappX.crt
TLS private key	http://classroom/pub/tls/private/webappX.key
TLS CA certificate	http://classroom/pub/example-ca.crt
Python application	/home/student/webapp.wsgi
The web application should be copied to a suitable location outside of any DocumentRoot.

Once you are done with your work, you can run the following command on your desktopX machine to validate your work:

[student@desktopX ~]$ lab webapp grade
Install the packages needed for httpd, TLS, and WSGI support.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo yum install httpd mod_ssl mod_wsgi
Create a suitable location on the file system on serverX to host the web application, then copy the application there.

Create a new directory /srv/webappX/www.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/webappX/www
Copy the application to its new home.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo cp ~/webapp.wsgi /srv/webappX/www/
Reset the SELinux context on the new directory.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo restorecon -Rv /srv/webappX
Download all the certificates and keys that you will need to configure TLS.

Download the example.com CA certificate to /etc/pki/tls/certs.

[student@serverX ~]$ cd /etc/pki/tls/certs
[student@serverX certs]$ sudo wget http://classroom.example.com/pub/example-ca.crt
Download the webappX.example.com certificate to /etc/pki/tls/certs.

[student@serverX certs]$ sudo wget http://classroom.example.com/pub/tls/certs/webappX.crt
Download the webappX private key to /etc/pki/tls/private/ and set the permissions to 0600.

[student@serverX certs]$ cd /etc/pki/tls/private
[student@serverX private]$ sudo wget http://classroom.example.com/pub/tls/private/webappX.key
[student@serverX private]$ sudo chmod 0600 webappX.key
Configure a new TLS name-based virtual host for https://webappX.example.com, using the web application for /, and using the keys and certificates you downloaded earlier.

Create a new file /etc/httpd/conf.d/webappX.conf with the following content:

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName webappX.example.com
  SSLEngine on
  SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
  SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5
  SSLHonorCipherOrder on 
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/webappX.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/X.key
  SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example-ca.crt
  WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/webappX/www/webapp.wsgi
</VirtualHost>
Add a <Directory> block to your new configuration to allow access to the web application:

<Directory /srv/webappX/www>
  require all granted
</Directory>
Start and enable your web server, and make the TLS-enabled web server available to the outside.

Start and enable httpd.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl start httpd.service
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
Open https in the default zone of the firewall on serverX.

[student@serverX ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
[student@serverX ~]$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
From your desktopX system, test the new web application.

Point an instance of firefox at https://webappX.example.com. Either import the example.com CA certificate as a trusted CA first, or accept the certificate warning.

Alternatively, you can run the following command on desktopX:

[student@desktopX ~]$ curl -k https://webappX.example.com
Validate your work by running lab webapp grade on desktopX.
