Preserving the systemd Journal
Configuring systemd-journald to permanently store the journal on disk.

Objectives
After completing this section, students should be able to configure systemd-journald to store its journal on disk rather than in memory.

Store the system journal permanently
By default, the systemd journal is kept in /run/log/journal, which means it is cleared when the system reboots. The journal is a new mechanism in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and for most installations, a detailed journal that starts with the last boot is sufficient.

If the directory /var/log/journal exists, the journal will log to that directory instead. The advantage of this is the historic data will be available immediately at boot. However, even with a persistent journal, not all data will be kept forever. The journal has a built-in log rotation mechanism that will trigger monthly. In addition, by default, the journal will not be allowed to get larger than 10% of the file system it is on, or leave less than 15% of the file system free. These values can be tuned in /etc/systemd/journald.conf, and the current limits on the size of the journal are logged when the systemd-journald process starts, as can be seen by the following command, which shows the top two lines of journalctl output:

[root@serverX ~]# journalctl | head -2
-- Logs begin at Wed 2014-03-05 15:13:37 CST, end at Thu 2014-03-06 21:57:54 CST. --
Mar 05 15:13:37 serverX.example.com systemd-journal[94]: Runtime journal is using 8.0M (max 277.8M, leaving 416.7M of free 2.7G, current limit 277.8M).
The systemd journal can be made persistent by creating the directory /var/log/journal as user root:

[root@serverX ~]# mkdir /var/log/journal
Ensure that the /var/log/journal directory is owned by the root user and group systemd-journal, and has the permissions 2755.

[root@serverX ~]# chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal
[root@serverX ~]# chmod 2755 /var/log/journal
Either a reboot of the system or sending the special signal USR1 as user root to the systemd-journald process is required.

[root@serverX ~]# killall -USR1 systemd-journald
Since the systemd journal is now persistent across reboots, journalctl -b can reduce the output by only showing the log messages since the last boot of the system.

[root@serverX ~]# journalctl -b
NOTE
When debugging a system crash with a persistent journal, it is usually required to limit the journal query to the reboot before the crash happened. The -b option can be accompanied by a negative number indicating to how many prior system boots the output should be limited. For example, the journalctl -b -1 limits the output to the previous boot.

Guided Exercise: Practice: Configure a Persistent systemd Journal
In this lab, students will make the systemd journal persistent.

Outcomes:

The systemd journal is written to disk.

Configure the systemd journal to be persistent across reboots.

Configure the directory /var/log/journal on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# mkdir /var/log/journal
[root@serverX ~]# chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal
[root@serverX ~]# chmod 2755 /var/log/journal
Send the USR1 signal to the systemd-journald or reboot serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# killall -USR1 systemd-journald
To verify the systemd journal is persistent, look for a new directory with the systemd journal log files that have been written to /var/log/journal. (The exact files which appear may vary on your system, but the directory should have similar contents to the following example.)

[root@serverX ~]# ls /var/log/journal/4513ad59a3b442ffa4b7ea88343fa55f
system.journal     user-1000.journal
