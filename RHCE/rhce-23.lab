[root@desktopX ~]# systemctl enable nfs-secure
Create the mount point /mnt/securespace on the desktopX system.

[root@desktopX ~]# mkdir /mnt/securespace
Create the entry in the /etc/fstab file to mount the /krbnfs share exported by the serverX system on the /mnt/securespace mount point on desktopX so that the SELinux labels from the share are shown on the mount point.

serverX:/krbnfs /mnt/securespace nfs defaults,v4.2,sec=krb5p 0 0
Mount the exported NFS share on the newly created /mnt/securespace directory on the desktopX system and verify the /etc/fstab entry works as expected.

[root@desktopX ~]# mount /mnt/securespace
Configure the serverX machine to share the newly created directory /sambaspace with SMB. Members of the auxiliary group sales have read and write permissions on the share. All users that are not member of the sales group have read permission. Ensure that all newly created files of a user that is a member of the sales group have the group ownership sales. The Samba server is in the salesdep workgroup and the share name in Samba is smbspace.

Deploy the required RPM packages to run the SMB service on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# yum -y install samba
Create the auxiliary system group sales on the serverX system.

[root@serverX ~]# groupadd -r sales
Create the /sambaspace directory on serverX.

[root@serverX ~]# mkdir -p /sambaspace
Change the group ownership of the /sambaspace directory to sales on the serverX system.

[root@serverX ~]# chgrp sales /sambaspace
Adjust the permissions on the /sambaspace directory to have the SGID bit set and write is prohibited by others.

[root@serverX ~]# chmod 2775 /sambaspace
Add the directory /sambaspace and all files shown as follows to the SELinux policy as a directory sharing files with SMB by setting its label to samba_share_t.

restorecon reset /sambaspace context unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0->system_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0
Change the /etc/samba/smb.conf configuration file on serverX. The workgroup is salesdep. The newly created SMB share is named smbspace and shares the /sambaspace directory where all members of the system group sales have write access.

Modify or confirm the following:

[global]
...
 workgroup = salesdep
...
 security = user
 passdb backend = tdbsam
Add a section at the end of the file as follows.

[smbspace]
 path = /sambaspace
 write list = @sales
Create the Samba-only user frank, who is part of the sales group. The user frank has read and write access to the smbspace SMB share. A new Samba user martin is created, who is not part of the sales team. The user martin has read access to the smbspace SMB share. Both newly added users have the SMB password redhat.

Install the samba-client RPM package because it contains the smbpasswd.
