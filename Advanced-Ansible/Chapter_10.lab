Lab: Constructing Advanced Job Workflows
Performance Checklist

In this exercise, you will create a new Workflow Job Template that uses a Survey to set variables, and Fact Caching to speed up the workflow.

Outcomes

You will be able to create a Workflow Job Template with an associated Survey and Notification Template and then launch a job from the Ansible Tower web UI using the Workflow Job Template.

You have an Ansible Tower instance installed and configured from an earlier exercise running on the tower system.

Log in as the student user with student as password on workstation and run lab project-review start. This script creates all the necessary objects (Git repository, Project, and Job Template) for use with the Prod Inventory.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab project-review start

Enable the Fact Caching option for the TEST webservers setup Job Template and PROD webservers setup Job Template.

In the navigation bar, click Templates.

If not already selected, select USE FACT CACHE to enable the Fact Caching option.

Click SAVE.
